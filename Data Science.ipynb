The degrees required for these jobs are Information Technology, management or even doctorates degrees. Salaries in India generally ranges from Rs10 lakhs per annum to Rs 12 Lakhs per annum. Observation states that an employee with 4 to 5 years of experience in data, possessing a certificate can get a hike of almost 70%. While employees with an experience of 8 to 10 years can get paid around 30 lakhs per annum.

    "**Mathematics and Data Science** - The core of building data product is the ability to view the huge volumes of data quantitatively. Building analytic models to solve business problems is usually hard math. Though statistics is an important part of data science, it is not the only type of math utilised. Many inferential techniques and machine learning and linear algebra are used by data scientists. It is necessary for a data scientist to have an overall depth of knowledge in mathematics. \n",

    "**Technical and programming skills** - Using technical skills to wrangle enormous data to create genuine solutions require complex programming skills. Data scientists need to be able to code - prototype quick solutions, as well as integrate with complex data systems. Core languages associated with data science include SQL, Python, R, and SAS. \n",
